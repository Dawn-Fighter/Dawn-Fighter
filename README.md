## 🚀 Projects

### Enigma — ESP32 Cybersecurity Toolkit
Open-source, portable toolkit for controlled wireless security research. Combines Wi‑Fi monitoring, iPhone BLE spam testing, RFID/NFC control, and real-time CLI control for researchers, students, and security enthusiasts.

- Wi‑Fi security & monitoring  
- iPhone BLE spamming (lab research)  
- RFID/NFC access control  
- Real-time CLI control

---

### WPT — Web Penetration Testing Tool
Advanced scanner for web applications to help security professionals, bug bounty hunters, and developers identify vulnerabilities.

- DNS enumeration & subdomain discovery  
- SSL/TLS configuration analysis  
- WAF detection  
- API endpoint discovery  
- JavaScript security analysis  
- Cookie security analysis  
- Form input validation testing

---

### Forge Vault / ForgeCrypt
Production-level CLI for secure file operations: recovery, encryption/decryption, hashing, and analysis with robust logging and error handling.

- File recovery from backup directories  
- File encryption/decryption; SHA256 hashing  
- File analysis (size, timestamps, MIME type)

---

### Keylogger (Windows, Python) — Educational PoC
Simple PoC for keystroke capture using pynput, stealth logging, and automated emailing for studying detection/defense.

- Obfuscated, random log file creation  
- Automatic keystroke emailing via Gmail  
- User deception splash image (research context)

---

### Password Extractor (Windows, Python) — Educational PoC
Demonstrates how browser-stored credentials, system info, and clipboard data can be collected on a local account and exported via secure email for blue-team awareness.

- Extracts credentials from Chrome/Edge/Opera/Opera GX/Brave  
- Decrypts passwords via system APIs  
- Collects OS/network fingerprint info  
- Reads clipboard, writes to hidden folder, auto-emails, then cleans up
